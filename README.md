# Lua-GPUDSP
GPU Dsp

# It's just the same algorithms
* But on the GPU
* It may not necessarily be faster than a CPU 
* Depends on how much and how big it is
* Will definitely be faster for very large data
* Small stuff is better on a CPU

# Algorithms
* DFT
* DCT
* FFT
* Fir Filter
* Convolution
* Correlation

# Cuda
* cuSignal
* MatX
* Cutlass
