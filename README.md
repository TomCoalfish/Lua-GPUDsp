# It's not really necessary
* So I collected it here mostly as it is something you can do
* And think about it
* I wanted to write my neural network into Cuda using Cutlass
* And to use cudnn-frontend to compute the cnn/rnn stuff 
* I might do it but I don't really use neural network for anythign other than ideas
* I would rather have the math and algorithm than use it
